	Learning Objectives
	At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

	General
	What are structures, when, why and how to use them
	How to use typedef
	Copyright - Plagiarism
	You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
	You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
	You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
	Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
	Requirements
	General
	Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
	All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
	All your files should end with a new line
	A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
	Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
	You are not allowed to use global variables
	No more than 5 functions per file
	The only C standard library functions allowed are printf, malloc, free and exit.
	In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
	Don’t forget to push your header file
	All your header files should be include guarded
	Quiz questions
